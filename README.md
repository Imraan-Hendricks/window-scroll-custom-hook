# window-scroll-custom-hook

This project demonstrates the use of window scroll events in react by creating a custom hook that provides the pageYOffset, whether the window is at the top and whether the user has scrolled up or down.

This information can further be used to create components that react to the state of the window, such as showing a fixed side bar menu only if the scroll direction is up and hiding it when the scroll direction is down or displaying/customizing components based on the page y offset or whether the window is at the top.
